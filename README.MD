## Fork, improve, and let's meet
If you're in Karachi, make sure to fork this repo, work on the game by improving its UI and make your own version out of it. Let's meet then in a future meetup and I'll give you some swag if you've really made something cool :)
I can't wait to see what you build with this.

Things you could do:
- Add stages. I.e. Stage1, Stage2 progressing forward 
- Maybe more than one apple?
- Different game speeds
- More than one lives before the score is reset
- Intro screen
